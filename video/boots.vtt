00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:06.604
Rainy boots  Drown instead of me

00:00:06.604 --> 00:00:10.222
I’ll just play the sadness to the place where I can’t go

00:00:10.222 --> 00:00:11.623
Rainy boots   

00:00:11.623 --> 00:00:17.395
I want to dance with all my heart to the sound that steps firmly on the bouncing words

00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:33.745
The city with the scent of melancholy after the rain

00:00:33.745 --> 00:00:37.083
Sunshine that pushes away the clouds

00:00:37.083 --> 00:00:42.702
Looks sleepily at the tears that’s built up

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.972
The right passage after the rain

00:00:46.972 --> 00:00:50.386
It’s wet and dangerous by your feet

00:00:50.386 --> 00:00:55.444
Watch out so you don’t get stuck in the mud

00:00:55.444 --> 00:01:00.196
Take the place of my favorite shoes

00:01:00.196 --> 00:01:03.601
I’ll play your words for you

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:06.926
If you don’t want to get on the late bus

00:01:06.926 --> 00:01:10.328
Jump on the rhythm of the tears built up bouncing up and down

00:01:10.328 --> 00:01:13.131
Rainy boots  Drown instead of me

00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:16.979
I’ll just play the sadness to the place where I can’t go

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.291
Rainy boots

00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:23.668
The sound that steps firmly on the bouncing words rings and even my heart is invincible

00:01:23.668 --> 00:01:25.667
Jump jump I can’t

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:30.114
The earth is being mean and is grabbing me

00:01:30.114 --> 00:01:32.449
Step step a bit difficult

00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:37.342
I quietly dance so I don’t fall in the rain

00:01:50.518 --> 00:01:53.560
After the rain puddles fill the street

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.870
How deep can you sink?

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.817
So busy raining and then stopping

00:01:59.817 --> 00:02:03.667
Some people are okay not wearing them

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:07.019
Be the savior of the rainy season

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:10.200
Watch, I’ll play with your words

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.427
A packed train is cloudy and out of control

00:02:13.427 --> 00:02:16.434
Let’s jump on the rhythm of the tears built up bouncing up and down

00:02:17.014 --> 00:02:19.760
Rainy boots  Drown instead of me

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.608
I’ll just play the sadness until I can’t see

00:02:23.608 --> 00:02:24.920
Rainy boots

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.220
I want to dance with all my heart to the sound that steps firmly on the bouncing words

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.220
Jump jump I can’t

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.708
The street ahead is not looking good so leave it up to me, I’m used to it

00:02:36.708 --> 00:02:39.145
Step step a bit difficult

00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:43.579
In the rain I sing quietly so I don’t get dirty

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.477
Jump jump I can’t

00:02:45.477 --> 00:02:50.089
The earth is being mean and is grabbing me

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:52.344
Step step a bit difficult

00:02:52.344 --> 00:02:57.109
I quietly dance so I don’t fall over in the rain
